-- the first letter of the primary_pocâ€™s first name (lowercase),
-- the last letter of their first name (lowercase),
-- the first letter of their last name (uppercase),
-- the last letter of their last name (uppercase),

-- the number of letters in their last name, and
-- the name of the company they are working with, no spaces
-- the forth and fifth digit of their sales rep id

-- 3. For the orders table, create a new column which shows the total number of transactions for all accounts.
SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_transactions

-- 10. Select the id, account_id, and standard_qty variable from the orders table,

-- 12. Use the NTILE functionality to divide the accounts into 4 levels in terms of the amount of standard_qty for their orders. 
-- Your resulting table should have the account_id, the occurred_at time for each order, 
-- the total amount of standard_qty paper purchased, and one of four levels in a standard_quartile column.
SELECT account_id, occurred_at, standard_qty,
